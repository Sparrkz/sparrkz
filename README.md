About me
--------
I build and operate secure, production-ready systems from idea → MVP → scale. My work blends backend engineering, systems architecture, and pragmatic security practices to deliver resilient SaaS and infrastructure for startups and product teams. I enjoy turning ambiguous problems into reliable systems and embedding security throughout the development lifecycle.

Current focus
-------------
- Backend engineering with Python & Django (APIs, multi-tenant SaaS, transactional systems)  
- Security automation and red-team-informed design (pentesting automation, threat modeling)  
- Production deployments on VPS / cloud with hands-on infra (Nginx, Gunicorn, Oracle Cloud, AlmaLinux/Ubuntu)

Core strengths
--------------
- Designing secure REST APIs, RBAC and JWT-based access control  
- Scalable relational data models and PostgreSQL transactional integrity  
- Owning end-to-end delivery: code, CI/CD, monitoring, and recovery plans  
- Systems architecture for startups: pragmatic trade-offs, observability, and operational resilience

Top technical skills
--------------------
- Python, Django, Django REST Framework  
- JavaScript, React, Node.js, Flutter  
- PostgreSQL, relational schema design, transaction-safe workflows  
- Linux server administration, Nginx, Gunicorn, Docker  
- Cybersecurity & ethical hacking, automated penetration testing  
- SaaS & multi-tenant architecture, RBAC, JWT, audit logging

Selected projects
-----------------
- Convade — Learning Management System  
  https://github.com/Sparrkz/Convade-2  
  Multi-tenant LMS with time-based course access, exams, certification, and lecturer onboarding.

- AutoHack AI — Automated penetration testing & red-teaming (private, in progress)  
  AI-enhanced penetration testing platform focusing on exploit chaining, validation, and reporting.

- Cloud IPTV Platform — Infrastructure project (Linux VPS)  
  A VPS-hosted IPTV solution for schools and churches using Plex and xTeVe.

- Digital Micro-Banking (Esusu Platform) — In progress  
  Backend for group savings, contributions, and secure payouts with strong transactional controls.

- AI Tutor for Exams — Early-stage  
  Backend for AI-assisted exam preparation tailored to local curricula.

Approach & values
-----------------
- Security-first: threat modeling, automated checks, and pen-test lessons applied to design  
- Ownership: ship features and operate the services that run them  
- Iterative product mindset: rapid MVPs, measurable hypotheses, then scale with data  
- Practical automation: CI/CD, monitoring, alerting, and clear runbooks
